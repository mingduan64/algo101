Certainly! Let's break down the Java code step by step:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        // Get the number of rows and columns in the matrix.
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;

        // Initialize the left and right pointers for binary search.
        int left = 0;
        int right = m * n - 1;
        
        // Perform binary search while left pointer is less than or equal to right pointer.
        while (left <= right) {
            // Calculate the middle index.
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            
            // Convert the middle index to row and column indices.
            int row = mid / n;
            int col = mid % n;
            
            // Compare the value at matrix[row][col] with the target.
            if (matrix[row][col] == target) {
                // If they are equal, the target is found, so return true.
                return true;
            } else if (matrix[row][col] < target) {
                // If the value is less than the target, update the left pointer
                // to search the right half of the remaining array.
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // If the value is greater than the target, update the right pointer
                // to search the left half of the remaining array.
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        // If the binary search loop exits without finding the target, return false.
        return false;
    }
}
```

Explanation of the code:

1. We start by obtaining the number of rows (`m`) and columns (`n`) in the given matrix.

2. We initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, for binary search. `left` represents the index of the first element in the flattened matrix, and `right` represents the index of the last element.

3. We enter a `while` loop that continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. This loop is the core of the binary search algorithm.

4. In each iteration of the loop:
    - We calculate the middle index `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.
    - We convert the `mid` index into row (`row`) and column (`col`) indices using integer division and modulus operations.

5. We compare the value at `matrix[row][col]` with the `target`:
    - If they are equal, we have found the target in the matrix, so we return `true`.
    - If the value is less than the `target`, it means the target must be in the right half of the remaining elements, so we update `left` to `mid + 1`.
    - If the value is greater than the `target`, it means the target must be in the left half of the remaining elements, so we update `right` to `mid - 1`.

6. We continue this process until the `left` pointer is no longer less than or equal to the `right` pointer, at which point we exit the `while` loop.

7. If the binary search loop exits without finding the target, we return `false` to indicate that the target is not present in the matrix.

Overall, this code efficiently performs a binary search on the flattened matrix, ensuring O(log(m * n)) time complexity.
