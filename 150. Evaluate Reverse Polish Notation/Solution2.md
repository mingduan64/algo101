Certainly! The `Solution2` class provides an alternative implementation for evaluating expressions in Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). This implementation uses a recursive approach and a private helper method called `eval`. Let's break down the code step by step:


import java.util.Set;

class Solution2 {
    private Set<String> operators = Set.of("+", "-", "*", "/");
    int lastIdx = 0;

    public int evalRPN(String[] tokens) {
        lastIdx = tokens.length - 1;
        return eval(tokens);
    }


1. The class `Solution2` is defined, and it initializes a `Set<String>` called `operators` containing the valid RPN operators: "+", "-", "*", and "/".

2. `lastIdx` is declared to keep track of the current index while processing the tokens.

3. The `evalRPN` method is the entry point for evaluating the RPN expression. It takes the array of tokens as input and initializes `lastIdx` to the index of the last element in the array.

4. It then calls the `eval` method with the tokens array.


    private int eval(String[] tokens) {
        if (lastIdx < 0) {
            return 0;
        }


5. The `eval` method is a private helper method used for recursive evaluation. It first checks if `lastIdx` has gone below zero, which would indicate that all tokens have been processed. In this case, it returns 0, which serves as a base case for the recursion.


        if (!operators.contains(tokens[lastIdx])) {
            return Integer.parseInt(tokens[lastIdx]);
        }


6. If the token at the current `lastIdx` is not an operator (i.e., it's a number), the method parses it into an integer and returns it. This represents the base case for numbers.


        String operator = tokens[lastIdx];
        lastIdx--;
        int num2 = eval(tokens);
        lastIdx--;
        int num1 = eval(tokens);


7. If the token at the current `lastIdx` is an operator, it is stored in the `operator` variable, and `lastIdx` is decremented.

8. Two recursive calls to the `eval` method are made to evaluate the expressions for the two operands (`num1` and `num2`). The result of these recursive calls is stored in the variables `num1` and `num2`.


        int result;
        if (operator.equals("+")) {
            result = num1 + num2;
        } else if (operator.equals("-")) {
            result = num1 - num2;
        } else if (operator.equals("*")) {
            result = num1 * num2;
        } else {
            result = num1 / num2;
        }


9. Finally, the method performs the operation specified by the `operator` on `num1` and `num2` and stores the result in the `result` variable. The operation depends on the type of operator encountered.

10. The `result` is then returned as the result of the evaluation.

This recursive approach processes each token in reverse order, evaluating expressions and reducing them to their final result. It correctly handles both numbers and operators, resulting in the correct evaluation of RPN expressions.
