    Two nested loops iterate through each cell of the 9x9 Sudoku board. 
The outer loop (row) iterates through the rows (0 to 8), and the inner loop (col) iterates through the columns (0 to 8).

    In each iteration, current is assigned the character value of the current cell in the board. 
This character represents either a digit ('1' to '9') or a dot ('.') indicating an empty cell.

    We check if the current cell is empty (indicated by a dot '.'). 
If it's empty, we skip further processing for this cell and move to the next cell using continue. This ensures that we only validate the filled cells.

    If the current cell is not empty (i.e., it contains a digit), we proceed with the validation.

    Checking the Row: We use the rows array of sets to keep track of the digits seen in each row. 
If the current digit is already in the set for the current row (rows[row].add(current) returns false), 
it means we have encountered a duplicate digit in the same row, which violates the Sudoku rule. In such a case, we immediately return false, indicating that the board is not valid.

    Checking the Column: Similarly, we use the cols array of sets to keep track of the digits seen in each column.
We check if the current digit is already in the set for the current column (cols[col].add(current) returns false). 
If it is, we return false to indicate an invalid board.

    Checking the 3x3 Sub-Box: Sudoku boards are divided into nine 3x3 sub-boxes. 
We use the boxes array of sets to keep track of the digits seen in each sub-box. 
The boxIndex is calculated based on the current row and column to determine which sub-box the current cell belongs to. 
If the current digit is already in the set for the current sub-box (boxes[boxIndex].add(current) returns false), we return false to indicate an invalid board.

    The code continues iterating through all cells, performing these checks for each filled cell.

    If we reach this point without encountering any duplicate digits in rows, columns, or sub-boxes, the board is considered valid, and the function returns true.

In summary, this code validates a Sudoku board by checking each filled cell to ensure that the digits in rows, columns, and 3x3 sub-boxes adhere to the Sudoku rules.
If any violation is found, it immediately returns false, indicating an invalid board.
