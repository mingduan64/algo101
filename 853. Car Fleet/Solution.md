Certainly! Let's go through the `carFleet` method in detail, step by step:

class Solution {
    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {

1. The `carFleet` method is defined within the `Solution` class. It takes three parameters:
    - `target`: The destination point, which is the target distance in miles.
    - `position`: An array of integers representing the initial positions of `n` cars.
    - `speed`: An array of integers representing the speeds of the `n` cars.

        int n = position.length;

2. We determine the number of cars, `n`, by getting the length of the `position` array. This will be useful for looping through the cars.

        // Create an array of cars with their position and time needed to reach the target.
        Car[] cars = new Car[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cars[i] = new Car(position[i], (double)(target - position[i]) / speed[i]);
        }

3. We create an array of `Car` objects called `cars`. Each `Car` object contains two attributes:
    - `position`: The initial position of the car.
    - `time`: The time needed for the car to reach the target, calculated as `(target - position[i]) / speed[i]`.

4. We use a loop to initialize the `cars` array by iterating through the `position` and `speed` arrays. For each car, we calculate its position and time to reach the target and create a `Car` object to store this information.

        // Sort the cars by their positions in descending order.
        Arrays.sort(cars, (a, b) -> Double.compare(b.position, a.position));

5. We sort the `cars` array in descending order based on the cars' initial positions. This sorting ensures that we process cars that are ahead first, as they may form fleets with cars behind them.

        int fleets = 0;
        double currentTime = 0.0;

6. We initialize two variables:
    - `fleets`: A counter to keep track of the number of car fleets.
    - `currentTime`: A variable to track the current time as we iterate through the cars.

        // Iterate through the sorted cars to determine fleets.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (cars[i].time > currentTime) {
                fleets++; // This car forms a new fleet.
                currentTime = cars[i].time; // Update the current time.
            }
        }

7. We loop through the sorted `cars` array. For each car, we check if its time to reach the target (`cars[i].time`) is greater than the `currentTime`. If it is, it means this car forms a new fleet because it takes more time to reach the target than the cars in front of it. We increment the `fleets` count and update the `currentTime` with the time of the current car.

8. We continue this process for all cars, effectively counting the number of fleets that will arrive at the destination.

        return fleets;
    }
    
    // Helper class to represent a car with position and time.
    class Car {
        double position;
        double time;
        
        public Car(double position, double time) {
            this.position = position;
            this.time = time;
        }
    }
}

9. Finally, we return the `fleets` count, which represents the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

The algorithm uses a combination of sorting and simulation to efficiently count the car fleets, considering their positions and speeds. It ensures that faster cars slow down to match slower cars when they form a fleet.
