Certainly! Let's go through the `carFleet` method in detail:

class Solution2 {
    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {

1. The `carFleet` method is defined within the `Solution2` class. It takes three parameters:
    - `target`: The destination point, which is the target distance in miles.
    - `position`: An array of integers representing the initial positions of `n` cars.
    - `speed`: An array of integers representing the speeds of the `n` cars.

        int fleets = 0;

2. We initialize a variable `fleets` to keep track of the number of car fleets. This variable will be incremented as cars form fleets.

        float[] time = new float[target];

3. We create an array `time` of `float` to represent the time it takes for each position to reach the target. The size of this array is set to `target` to accommodate positions from 0 to `target-1`.

        float maxTime = 0;

4. We initialize a variable `maxTime` to store the maximum time encountered. This variable will be used to determine if a car forms a new fleet.

        for (int i = 0; i < position.length; i++) {
            time[position[i]] = (float) (target - position[i]) / speed[i];
        }

5. We loop through each car's position and calculate the time it takes for that car to reach the target. This time is calculated as `(target - position[i]) / speed[i]` and is stored in the `time` array at the corresponding position.

        for (int i = target - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (time[i] > maxTime) {
                maxTime = time[i];
                fleets++;
            }
        }

6. We then loop through the `time` array in reverse order, starting from the target position and moving backward. For each position, we compare the calculated time (`time[i]`) with the `maxTime`. If the calculated time is greater, it means the car at that position forms a new fleet because it takes longer to reach the target than any car encountered so far. In this case, we update `maxTime` and increment the `fleets` count.

7. Finally, we return the `fleets` count, which represents the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

This approach efficiently calculates the time it takes for each car to reach the target, and by iterating backward through the positions, it correctly identifies when new fleets are formed due to slower cars catching up to faster cars.
