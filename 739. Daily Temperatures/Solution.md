Certainly! Let's go through the `dailyTemperatures` method step by step, explaining how it calculates the number of days you have to wait for a warmer temperature for each day:

class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {

1. The `dailyTemperatures` method is defined within the `Solution` class. It takes an array of integers called `temperatures` as input and returns an array of integers representing the number of days you have to wait for a warmer temperature.

        int n = temperatures.length;

2. We determine the length of the `temperatures` array and store it in the variable `n`. This helps in looping through the array.

        int[] answer = new int[n];

3. We create an integer array called `answer` of the same length as the input `temperatures`. This `answer` array will store the number of days you have to wait for a warmer temperature for each day.

        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

4. We create a stack called `stack` to keep track of the indices of the temperatures. This stack will be used to find warmer temperatures as we iterate through the array.

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

5. We start iterating through the `temperatures` array using a loop. `i` represents the index of the current day.

            while (!stack.isEmpty() && temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack.peek()]) {

6. Inside the loop, we check if the stack is not empty (`!stack.isEmpty()`) and if the current temperature `temperatures[i]` is greater than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack (`temperatures[stack.peek()]`).

7. If the above condition is true, it means we have found a warmer day. We enter the while loop to calculate the number of days you have to wait for a warmer temperature for each day. We continue this process until either the stack becomes empty or the current temperature is not greater than the temperature at the top of the stack.

                int j = stack.pop();

8. Inside the while loop, we pop the index `j` from the stack. This index represents a cooler day for which we have now found a warmer day.

                answer[j] = i - j;

9. We calculate the number of days you have to wait for a warmer temperature for the cooler day represented by index `j`. This is done by subtracting `j` from the current day index `i`, and we store this value in the `answer` array at index `j`.

10. This process continues until there are no more cooler days (days with temperatures lower than the current day) in the stack or until the current temperature is not greater than the temperature at the top of the stack.

            stack.push(i);

11. After calculating the waiting days for the current day, we push the current index `i` onto the stack. This is because we still need to find warmer days for the current day and potentially for future days.

        }

        return answer;
    }
}

12. Finally, after looping through all the days, we return the `answer` array, which contains the number of days you have to wait for a warmer temperature for each day. If there is no future day for which this is possible, the corresponding element in the `answer` array will be 0.

In summary, this code uses a stack to efficiently find the waiting days for a warmer temperature for each day in the input array. It does so by comparing temperatures and updating the `answer` array accordingly.
