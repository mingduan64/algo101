    Create a StringBuilder named encodedString to build the encoded string.

    Loop through each string in the strs list.

    For each character c in the current string (converted to a character array for iteration):

    Check if c is equal to the delimiter character (DELIMITER) or the escape character (ESCAPE_CHAR).

    If c is equal to the delimiter or escape character, add an escape character (ESCAPE_CHAR) to encodedString. 
    This ensures that we escape these characters when encoding.

    Append the character c to encodedString. This could be a regular character or an escaped character.

    After processing all characters in the current string, append the delimiter character (DELIMITER) to encodedString. 
    This indicates the end of one string and the start of the next one.

    Repeat steps 3 to 7 for each string in strs.

    Finally, return the encoded string by converting the StringBuilder to a String using toString().

    Create an empty list decodedStrings to store the decoded strings.

    Create a StringBuilder named currentString to build the current string being decoded.

    Initialize a boolean variable escaped to false. This flag indicates whether the next character should be treated as an escaped character.

    Loop through each character c in the input string s (converted to a character array for iteration).

    Check if escaped is true. 
    If it is, it means the current character should be treated as an escaped character, so append c to the currentString and reset the escaped flag to false.

    If escaped is false, check if c is equal to the escape character (ESCAPE_CHAR). 
    If it is, set the escaped flag to true to indicate that the next character should be treated as an escaped character.

    If escaped is false and c is not the escape character, check if c is equal to the delimiter character (DELIMITER). 
    If it is, it means the end of the current string, so add the content of currentString to the decodedStrings list, and reset currentString to an empty state.

    If none of the above conditions apply, it means c is a regular character, so append it to the currentString.

    After processing all characters in the input string s, check if there is any content left in currentString (i.e., it's not empty). 
    If there is, add it to the decodedStrings list.

    Finally, return the decodedStrings list containing all the decoded strings.

    This updated implementation correctly handles escaping of characters and decoding, ensuring that input strings like ["\\"] are decoded to ["\\"].
