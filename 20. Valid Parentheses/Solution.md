Approach:
The code uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets as they are encountered while iterating through the input string. It checks if each closing bracket matches the most recent opening bracket on the stack. If the brackets are properly matched and nested, the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

    Initialize an empty stack (stk) to keep track of opening brackets encountered.

    Iterate through each character of the input string s.

    If the current character is an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '['), push it onto the stack stk.

    If the current character is a closing bracket (')', '}', or ']'), do the following:
        Check if the stack stk is empty:
            If the stack is empty, return false because there is no matching opening bracket for the current closing bracket, indicating invalid nesting.
        Check if the top of the stack (stk.peek()) matches the current closing bracket using the isMatching function:
            If they match, pop the top element from the stack to indicate that this pair of brackets is correctly matched.
            If they don't match, return false because the brackets are not correctly matched.

    After processing all characters in the input string:
        Check if the stack stk is empty:
            If the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have been correctly matched with closing brackets, and the function returns true, indicating valid nesting.
            If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns false, indicating invalid nesting.

    The isMatching function is a helper function that checks if two characters (a and b) form a valid matching pair of brackets. It returns true if a is an opening bracket and b is the corresponding closing bracket, and false otherwise.

In summary, this code efficiently solves the problem by using a stack to track opening brackets and checking if each closing bracket matches the most recent opening bracket on the stack. If all brackets are correctly matched and nested, the input string is considered valid, and the function returns true. Otherwise, it returns false, indicating invalid nesting.
