    Initialize variables:
        res: This variable will store the total trapped rainwater and is initially set to 0.
        left_max: This variable is used to keep track of the maximum height encountered while traversing from the left side of the array and is initially set to 0.
        right_max: This variable is used to keep track of the maximum height encountered while traversing from the right side of the array and is initially set to 0.
        left: This variable is an index pointer starting from the left end (index 0) of the array.
        right: This variable is an index pointer starting from the right end (index height.length - 1) of the array.

    Enter a while loop that continues as long as left is less than right. This loop will traverse the array from both ends towards the center, and it stops when the two pointers meet in the middle.

    Inside the loop, update left_max and right_max:
        Calculate the maximum height encountered from the left side by taking the maximum value between the current left_max and the height at index left in the height array.
        Calculate the maximum height encountered from the right side by taking the maximum value between the current right_max and the height at index right in the height array.

    Determine the shorter maximum height:
        Check if left_max is less than right_max. If it is, this means that there is the potential to trap rainwater between the bars at positions left and right.

    Calculate the trapped rainwater and update res:
        If left_max is less than right_max, calculate the amount of trapped rainwater between the bar at position left and the bar at position right. This is done by subtracting the height of the bar at index left from left_max and adding the result to res. This accounts for the trapped rainwater at position left.
        Increment the left pointer to move it to the next bar on the left.

    Handle the case when right_max is less than or equal to left_max:
        If left_max is not less than right_max, this means there's a potential to trap rainwater between the bars at positions left and right.
        Calculate the amount of trapped rainwater between the bar at position left and the bar at position right by subtracting the height of the bar at index right from right_max and add the result to res. This accounts for the trapped rainwater at position right.
        Decrement the right pointer to move it to the next bar on the right.

    The loop continues until the left and right pointers meet in the middle of the array.

    After the loop completes, the method returns the res variable, which contains the total amount of trapped rainwater.

In summary, this code implements the same efficient algorithm as the previous one to calculate the trapped rainwater, using two pointers and updating the left_max and right_max values as it traverses the array. It determines the amount of trapped rainwater at any position based on the minimum of the maximum heights encountered from the left and right sides.
