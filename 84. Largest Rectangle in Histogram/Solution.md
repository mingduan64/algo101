Certainly! Let's break down the algorithm step by step, explaining each part in detail:

    class Solution {
    public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {

We start by defining the `largestRectangleArea` method, which takes an array `heights` representing the heights of bars in a histogram as input and returns the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed within the histogram.

        int n = heights.length;

We determine the number of bars in the histogram by calculating the length of the `heights` array and store it in the variable `n`.

        int[] left = new int[n];  // To store the left boundary of each bar
        int[] right = new int[n]; // To store the right boundary of each bar
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>(); // Stack to maintain indices

We initialize two arrays `left` and `right`, each of size `n`, to store the left and right boundaries for each bar. Additionally, we create a stack called `stack` to keep track of indices of bars in non-decreasing order of heights.

        // Calculate the left boundaries for each bar
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && heights[stack.peek()] >= heights[i]) {
                stack.pop(); // Pop until we find a smaller height
            }
            left[i] = stack.isEmpty() ? 0 : stack.peek() + 1;
            stack.push(i);
        }

In this section, we calculate the left boundaries for each bar:
- We iterate through the `heights` array from left to right using a `for` loop.
- Inside the loop, we use a `while` loop to pop elements from the `stack` until we find a bar with a smaller height than the current bar `heights[i]`. This process ensures that the stack contains indices of bars with increasing heights.
- The left boundary for `heights[i]` is calculated as the index on top of the stack plus 1. If the stack is empty, we set the left boundary to 0.
- We push the current index `i` onto the stack.

This section ensures that we correctly determine the left boundary for each bar in the histogram.

        // Clear the stack and calculate the right boundaries for each bar
        stack.clear();
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && heights[stack.peek()] >= heights[i]) {
                stack.pop(); // Pop until we find a smaller height
            }
            right[i] = stack.isEmpty() ? n - 1 : stack.peek() - 1;
            stack.push(i);
        }

Similar to the previous section, we now calculate the right boundaries for each bar:
- We clear the `stack` to start with an empty stack.
- We iterate through the `heights` array from right to left using a `for` loop.
- Inside the loop, we use a `while` loop to pop elements from the `stack` until we find a bar with a smaller height than the current bar `heights[i]`.
- The right boundary for `heights[i]` is calculated as the index on top of the stack minus 1. If the stack is empty, we set the right boundary to `n - 1`.
- We push the current index `i` onto the stack.

This section ensures that we correctly determine the right boundary for each bar in the histogram.

        int maxArea = 0;

We initialize a variable `maxArea` to store the maximum rectangle area found within the histogram. This variable will be updated as we iterate through the bars.

        // Calculate the maximum area for each bar
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int width = right[i] - left[i] + 1;
            int area = heights[i] * width;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
        }

In this section, we iterate through the `heights` array to calculate the maximum area for each bar:
- For each bar at index `i`, we calculate its width by subtracting the left boundary `left[i]` from the right boundary `right[i]` and adding 1.
- The area of the rectangle formed by the current bar is calculated as the product of its height `heights[i]` and its width.
- We update the `maxArea` by taking the maximum value between the current `maxArea` and the area of the current rectangle.

This section ensures that we find the maximum area that can be formed using each bar in the histogram.

        return maxArea;
    }
}

Finally, we return the `maxArea` as the result, which represents the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed within the given histogram.

Overall, this algorithm efficiently calculates the largest rectangle area in the histogram by determining left and right boundaries for each bar using a stack-based approach. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram, making it an efficient solution for this problem.
