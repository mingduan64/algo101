Certainly! The provided code generates all combinations of well-formed parentheses for a given value of `n` using backtracking. Let's go through it step by step:


import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
        List<String> answer = new ArrayList<>();
        backtracking(answer, new StringBuilder(), 0, 0, n);
        
        return answer;
    }


1. The `generateParenthesis` method is the entry point for generating combinations of well-formed parentheses. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of strings representing all valid combinations of parentheses. It initializes an empty list called `answer` to store the generated combinations.

2. The method then calls the `backtracking` method, passing in the `answer` list, an empty `StringBuilder` called `curString` to start building combinations, and four parameters:
    - `leftCount`: The count of open parentheses in the current combination.
    - `rightCount`: The count of close parentheses in the current combination.
    - `n`: The total number of pairs of parentheses to be generated.


    private void backtracking(List<String> answer, StringBuilder curString, int leftCount, int rightCount, int n) {


3. The `backtracking` method is a recursive helper function that generates valid combinations of parentheses. It takes several parameters:
    - `answer`: The list to store valid combinations.
    - `curString`: The current combination being built as a `StringBuilder`.
    - `leftCount`: The count of open parentheses in the current combination.
    - `rightCount`: The count of close parentheses in the current combination.
    - `n`: The total number of pairs of parentheses to be generated.


        if (curString.length() == 2 * n) {
            answer.add(curString.toString());
            return;
        }


4. The base case of the recursion checks whether the length of the `curString` equals `2 * n`. If it does, it means we have formed a valid combination of `n` pairs of parentheses, so we convert the `curString` to a string and add it to the `answer` list. Then, the function returns, ending this branch of the recursion.


        if (leftCount < n) {
            curString.append("(");
            backtracking(answer, curString, leftCount + 1, rightCount, n);
            curString.deleteCharAt(curString.length() - 1);
        }


5. In the first recursive case, if the count of open parentheses (`leftCount`) is less than `n`, we append an open parenthesis `"("` to the `curString`, increment the `leftCount`, and call `backtracking` recursively with the updated parameters. This represents adding an open parenthesis to the current combination.

6. After the recursive call, we remove the last character from `curString` (the open parenthesis) using `deleteCharAt`. This is important for backtracking because it allows us to explore other possibilities.


        if (leftCount > rightCount) {
            curString.append(")");
            backtracking(answer, curString, leftCount, rightCount + 1, n);
            curString.deleteCharAt(curString.length() - 1);
        }


7. In the second recursive case, if the count of open parentheses (`leftCount`) is greater than the count of close parentheses (`rightCount`), we append a close parenthesis `")"` to the `curString`, increment the `rightCount`, and call `backtracking` recursively with the updated parameters. This represents adding a close parenthesis to the current combination.

8. Similar to the first case, after the recursive call, we remove the last character from `curString` (the close parenthesis) using `deleteCharAt`.

9. The recursion continues until the base case is reached for each branch of the recursion. As a result, all valid combinations of well-formed parentheses are generated and stored in the `answer` list.

10. Finally, the `generateParenthesis` method returns the `answer` list containing all valid combinations of well-formed parentheses for the given value of `n`.

This code efficiently generates all possible combinations of well-formed parentheses by exploring all valid options using backtracking and properly maintaining the state of open and close parentheses counts.
