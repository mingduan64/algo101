Certainly! Let's break down the code step by step, explaining how it generates all combinations of well-formed parentheses for a given value of `n`.


import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<String> generateParenthesis(int n) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        generateParenthesisHelper(result, "", 0, 0, n);
        return result;
    }


1. The `generateParenthesis` method is the entry point for generating combinations of well-formed parentheses. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of strings representing all valid combinations of parentheses. It initializes an empty list called `result` to store the generated combinations.

2. The method then calls the `generateParenthesisHelper` method, passing in the `result` list, an empty string `""` to start building combinations, and four parameters:
    - `current`: The current combination being constructed.
    - `open`: The count of open parentheses in the current combination.
    - `close`: The count of close parentheses in the current combination.
    - `n`: The total number of pairs of parentheses to be generated.


    private void generateParenthesisHelper(List<String> result, String current, int open, int close, int n) {


3. The `generateParenthesisHelper` method is a recursive helper function that generates valid combinations of parentheses. It takes several parameters:
    - `result`: The list to store valid combinations.
    - `current`: The current combination being built.
    - `open`: The count of open parentheses in the current combination.
    - `close`: The count of close parentheses in the current combination.
    - `n`: The total number of pairs of parentheses to be generated.


        // Base case: If the current string has reached the desired length, add it to the result.
        if (current.length() == 2 * n) {
            result.add(current);
            return;
        }


4. The base case of the recursion checks whether the length of the `current` string equals `2 * n`. If it does, it means we have formed a valid combination of `n` pairs of parentheses, so we add it to the `result` list, and the function returns, ending this branch of the recursion.


        // Recursive case 1: Add an open parenthesis if the count of open parentheses is less than n.
        if (open < n) {
            generateParenthesisHelper(result, current + "(", open + 1, close, n);
        }


5. In the first recursive case, if the count of open parentheses (`open`) is less than `n`, we add an open parenthesis `"("` to the `current` string, increment the `open` count, and call `generateParenthesisHelper` recursively with the updated parameters. This represents adding an open parenthesis to the current combination.


        // Recursive case 2: Add a close parenthesis if the count of close parentheses is less than open.
        if (close < open) {
            generateParenthesisHelper(result, current + ")", open, close + 1, n);
        }


6. In the second recursive case, if the count of close parentheses (`close`) is less than the count of open parentheses (`open`), we add a close parenthesis `")"` to the `current` string, increment the `close` count, and call `generateParenthesisHelper` recursively with the updated parameters. This represents adding a close parenthesis to the current combination.

7. The recursion continues until the base case is reached for each branch of the recursion. As a result, all valid combinations of well-formed parentheses are generated and stored in the `result` list.

8. Finally, the `generateParenthesis` method returns the `result` list containing all valid combinations of well-formed parentheses for the given value of `n`.
